**Task**:
For each of the following claims, rate how well the provided passage supports it on a scale of 1 to 3, where:
- **1** means "Same Information,"
- **2** means "Different but Similar Information," and
- **3** means "unsupported."

Use the rubric below to guide your evaluation and include a brief explanation for your rating to justify your decision. Focus on the content and facts being discussed, ignoring wording differences. Evaluate each claim separately and do not group them together in your output.

**Rubric**:
1. *Same Information*: The claim exactly matches the corresponding
information in the passage. The claim could be a direct quote
from the passage or a paraphrase that captures the same
information.
2. *Different but Similar Information*: The claim is not identical
to the passage but captures the same or closely related
information. For example, the claim could be an abstraction of
the corresponding information in the passage, or it could
have minor differences that do not significantly change its
overall meaning.
3. *Unsupported*: The claim is not supported by the passage. It
could either be not discussed at all in the passage or
inconsistent with the passage.

You are provided with a concise medical case summary. Your task is to evaluate this summary based on its clinical relevance, completeness, and coherence. Use the following 5-point scale:
1 (Very Poor): The summary is severely lacking in critical information, contains major contradictions, or is so incomplete that it fails to provide a meaningful picture of the patient’s condition.
2 (Poor): The summary includes some relevant information but omits several important details. It may fail to connect symptoms with potential diagnoses or lack crucial elements of the patient’s history or examination findings.
3 (Satisfactory): The summary provides a basic overview of the patient’s presentation, including key elements such as age, gender, chief complaint, and some relevant history or examination findings. However, it may lack depth or miss some important details.
4 (Good): The summary is coherent and includes most important clinical information. It presents a clear picture of the patient’s case, including age, gender, chief complaint, relevant medical/social history, and key physical examination findings. Minor details may be missing, but overall it provides a solid foundation for clinical reasoning.
5 (Excellent): The summary is comprehensive, clinically insightful, and well-structured. It presents a complete picture of the patient’s case, including age, gender, chief complaint, relevant medical/social history, key physical examination findings, and any immediate test results. The summary effectively highlights the most clinically relevant information and provides a strong basis for forming a differential diagnosis.

Evaluation Instructions:
Read the case summary carefully.
Assess the summary based on the above criteria, focusing on its clinical relevance, completeness, and coherence.
Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) justifying your rating, highlighting specific strengths or weaknesses.
Assign a rating from 1 to 5.

Your response should follow this format:
Explanation: [Your 2-3 sentence justification]
Rating: [Your rating (1-5)]
Remember, you are evaluating the quality and completeness of the case summary itself, not making a diagnosis or judging the medical decisions. Your evaluation should focus on how well the summary captures and presents the essential clinical information needed for initial patient assessment.

--- Evaluating the Text Coherence of the Responses from an Online Medical Diagnosis Assistant---

You will receive a detailed description of a medical problem and the response provided by an online medical diagnosis assistant. Your task is to evaluate the text coherence of the response. Use the following 5-point scale:

1 (Very Incoherent): The content of the response is chaotic, and there is a lack of logical connection between sentences, making it difficult to understand the overall meaning. For example, there is a jumpy thought process between sentences, the front and back expressions are not related, or there are grammatical errors that lead to semantic ambiguity.

2 (Incoherent): The response has a certain degree of logical unclearness, and the connection of some parts is not natural enough. It may be that when presenting viewpoints or providing information, the order is chaotic, requiring the reader to spend a lot of effort to sort out the relationships. For example, the treatment method is mentioned first, and then suddenly jumps to the analysis of the cause of the disease without a reasonable transition.

3 (Moderately Coherent): The response can basically express a clear meaning, and the logic is relatively smooth, but in some parts, there may be situations where the expression is not refined enough or the logic is not tight enough. For example, a lot of redundant information is used, or the transition between different viewpoints is slightly stiff.

4 (Coherent): The text of the response is well-organized, with logical and hierarchical sentences. It can elaborate on the problem in a reasonable order, such as first analyzing the cause of the disease, then giving diagnostic suggestions and treatment methods, etc., and the transition is natural and smooth. The reader can easily understand the main idea of the response and the relationship between each part.

5 (Very Coherent): The response is not only logically tight and structurally clear, but also very smooth and natural in language expression. The connection between each part is seamless, and it can guide the reader to gradually and deeply understand the solution to the problem like a complete medical article. For example, appropriate conjunctions and transitional sentences are used to make the whole response flow smoothly.

Evaluation Instructions:
Read the problem description and the response of the diagnosis assistant carefully.
Evaluate the text coherence of the response according to the above criteria, focusing on the logical relationship between sentences, the organization order of the content, and the fluency of language expression.
Provide a brief explanation (2 - 3 sentences) to justify your rating, highlighting the specific performance of the response in terms of coherence.
Give a rating from 1 to 5.
Your response should follow this format:
Rating: [Your rating (1 - 5)]
Explanation: [Your 2 - 3 sentence justification]
